    <h2>You Can Sell Any Kind of Clothing With the One Price Concept</h2>
    <em>Junior, Kids, Men’s, Women’s, Urban Clothing, Athletic Apparel, and More</em>
   <p>
    The great thing is the selection of merchandise will be evolving constantly to the customer base.  Store owners will use numerous vendors from week to week, season to season and we can assist the store owner with accomplishing all this. Store Owners can carry name brand items that are bought through closeout vendors. Closeouts are usually merchandise that was not bought by the end of the season, and to prevent the manufacturer from sitting on the merchandise or take a loss, they sell the items at rock bottom prices to move the items faster and make room for the next seasons line.
    </p>
    <p>
    The bottom line is a store owner can sell whatever category or combination of categories that they want to feature in their store.  Store owners have 100% control over what the price point of the store will be whether ONE PRICE or individually priced.  Our recommendation is to stick to the original “ONE PRICE clothing store” theme.  Maintaining that value packed “ONE PRICE” identity will keep the target customers focused on the eye-popping values in the store.  We will counsel the store owner on how to order and who will be the best vendors for the store concept.  Our goal is to give store owners the best profit margin and most competitive pricing to fill their store with bargain hunting customers.

    <h2>Why Should I Start a Discount Clothing Store Now?</h2>
	<em>Why now?  Because now is the best time to take control of your destiny, become the boss and gain your financial independence.  </em>
    <p>
    Really any time of year is a great time to start a clothing business.  The retail clothing industry revolves around cycles that repeat every year beginning with the back to school season and following through to the holiday seasons.  In between the seasons are common events like high school proms, graduation parties, and of course swimsuit season.  On top of these seasons and common events there are birthdays, parties, weddings, and more.  As important as focusing on these seasons, special occasions and events it is even more vital that the store owner is prepared for them and react properly and on-time with a pre-emptive schedule that keeps the store’s inventory ahead of the curve.  The Holiday seasons will generate on average 30% of a clothing store’s sales for the year!  However, no matter when the store owner opens their doors there is a season to immediately take advantage of – which accounts for the other 70% of the year.  Therefore, it is best that the new store owner begin the process as soon as possible in order to solidify public awareness and get their marketing plan in place.

                    <p>
                   When we say everything is included within the retail space of the store in the package price, we mean EVERYTHING – including the keys to the front door of the new store.

                    <p>
                    We walk every store owner thru the entire financial process giving them a clear understanding of what they will need to understand before opening up their clothing store.  We will do the major work of helping the store owner find the right location for their store and assist them with the lease negotiations.  The General Manager of $10 Clothing Stores will personally review and write out an estimated projection based on past performance of stores in the area as well as the store owner’s merchandise selection and customer base.  We will build-out the store completely – including full assembly of all fixtures mirroring the top clothing retailers, eye-popping merchandise displays, visually exciting interior signage, and total equipment installation.  There is even a budget for the exterior signage of the store.  EVERYTHING! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    All the complicated steps involved in the development of the clothing store should actually be the least of the store owner’s concerns.  All that is needed for a serious entrepreneur to become a clothing store owner is to submit the 100% refundable deposit today and get started.   </p>
